                <h1>Digital Decay: What Happens to AI-Generated Content Over Time on the Internet</h1>

<img src="blog19.png" alt="Digital Decay Illustration">

 <h1>Introduction: Digital Decay and AI-Generated Content</h1>

    <p>
        We tend to think of the internet as a permanent involvement, but it is created (or not) with a finite life span, and even AI-created content will eventually disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
        The process of decay is different than physical decay, such as the degradation of an article (paper) or the ink that created an image (the print). Both types of decay take place over a period of time, and while digital content is no longer made with paper or ink, it is still considered a product of the creative process of humans who created it; therefore, both contain a 'context' of the people who created that digital content.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI has made the process of creating content faster for humans to produce, however, AI has also made the process of ‘digital decay’ faster in terms of its evolution. For example, how many pieces of text created by AI will actually be preserved in future generations as a means to create value, and how many will simply fade into oblivion?
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of this blog is to examine how digital content evolves with time, and the uncertainty surrounding the forecast for future generations’ evaluation of the current Internet marketplace in their evaluation of digital products.
    </p>

    <h2>How AI-generated Content Ages More Quickly Than Human-generated Content</h2>
    <p>AI is rapid.</p>
    <p>AI is high-speed.</p>
    <p>AI is changing rapidly.</p>
    <p>That's why AI-generated content is aging faster!</p>

    <p>The following are some of the reasons.</p>

    <h3>1. AI Models Freeze Knowledge in Time</h3>
    <p>
        AI-generated content is a snapshot of when the AI model was trained.
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, if an AI model was trained in 2024 and a blog post is created today, that blog post would not contain information about events that occurred in 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
        This causes knowledge decay, where the content is no longer current.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Over-production of Content Creates an Over-lapping of Information</h3>
    <p>
        AI can produce an unlimited amount of content and, as a result, older content is pushed down the page and replaced by newer versions, which results in content being buried or obscured.
    </p>
    <p>
        The search engines favor the new, fresh content, which leads to visibility decay where the content is still present but not visible.
    </p>

    <h3>3. The Changing Definition of What Qualifies As Quality Content</h3>
    <p>
        As the AI model continues to evolve, older content that is produced by the AI will be seen as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Repetitive;</li>
        <li>Less creative;</li>
        <li>Less accurate;</li>
        <li>Less structured.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        People will quickly recognize an "older style" of AI-generated content just like we are able to quickly identify a website that is out of date.
    </p>
    <p>This causes a style decay.</p>

    <h3>4. Links and References Become Obsolete</h3>
    <p>
        Older AI-generated content will often contain references to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Outdated pages;</li>
        <li>Broken links;</li>
        <li>Expired APIs;</li>
        <li>Deleted resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This creates a technical decay.</p>

    <h3>5. The Echo Chamber Effect of AI, Which Causes Data Drift</h3>
    <p>
        When a new AI reads older AI-generated content, several things can happen:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The information becomes simplified;</li>
        <li>The context is lost;</li>
        <li>The facts become distorted;</li>
        <li>There is a repetition of patterns; and</li>
        <li>There is a decrease in originality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This creates a semantic decay where the meaning changes as the content ages.</p>

    <h2>Digital Decay of AI Content</h2>
    <p>Digital decay is actually a series of things happening across time, not just a singular action.</p>
    <p>A few significant forms of Digital Decay are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy decay</strong> - The older the article, the less accurate it may become. Technology advances, scientific discoveries occur, specifications change regularly, and laws are revised all the time. An article about future cars written by an AI during 2020 may now seem outdated.</li>
        <li><strong>Context Decay</strong> - The meaning of latest memes, current slang, etc., diminishes rapidly. For instance, a joke that was considered funny in 2023 may not be funny or correct in 2030. Content generated by AI is particularly vulnerable to context decay since the content generally follows current trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Search Engine Decay</strong> - Old content will fall behind in search engines for several reasons. It stops being ranked and algorithms will prefer more up-to-date content based on current key words and the introduction of new competitors. Therefore, the old content becomes a ghost page.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform Decay</strong> - Digital platforms change frequently due to multiple factors, including new apps being created and old platforms shutting down, outdated formats, etc. Once an app or web app has shut down, any post written on that platform has died.</li>
        <li><strong>Format Decay</strong> - There are some documents that are not readable anymore (like flash games) due to unsupported formats, retired formats, or no longer being compatible with current operating systems. Millions of unique flash game documents became unplayable files.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation Decay</strong> - Readers of the future will misunderstand any response to AI generated: explanations, forecasting, jokes, metaphors. The intended meaning will shift gradually over many years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Digital Decay Has more Significant Sociocultural Implications with AI Content</h2>
    <p>Because of the following reasons, AI content will cause larger Digital Decay that has wider Sociocultural implications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased quantity</li>
        <li>Less curation (no human involvement)</li>
        <li>Quick production</li>
        <li>More Semantics (More words with similar meanings)</li>
        <li>Differences in sourcing mechanisms (getting to the source of AI content is more complicated)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Will AIs in the future utilize decayed data?</h2>
    <p>If the model continues training via a decayed resource, it inherits the decayed content.</p>
    <p>Model Decay.</p>

    <h2>Will the Internet be filled with a mixture of newer and older outdated text from AIs?</h2>
    <p>
        Similarly to sedimentary layers on the ground, a layer of digital garbage could be formed on the Internet due to all of the text produced by AIs.
    </p>

    <h2>Will users lose faith in the accuracy of information online?</h2>
    <p>When content becomes old and outdated, users lose trust in that site.</p>

    <h2>Will history be written incorrectly?</h2>
    <p>
        Consider that in 2075, historians are going to review content written in 2025. They need to identify clearly:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What was produced by AIs</li>
        <li>What was produced by humans</li>
        <li>What was speculative</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If they cannot differentiate between these three categories, it may lead to an increase in confusion.
    </p>

    <h2>How will Future Systems Combat Decay?</h2>
    <p>Researchers are investigating how to properly preserve digital content.</p>

    <h3>1. Version Identification for AI-generated Content</h3>
    <p>The article should contain the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The model's version number</li>
        <li>Creation date</li>
        <li>Knowledge cut-off date</li>
        <li>History of updates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Providing all of this data will help a reader understand the relevance of the article when they read it.</p>

    <h3>2. Periodically Updating AI-generated Content</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Correcting out-of-date information</li>
        <li>Updating referenced materials/links</li>
        <li>Deleting broken links</li>
        <li>Improving the articles for readability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Essentially, this is like a "maintenance" procedure.</p>

    <h3>3. Decay Detection Models</h3>
    <p>Future AI will be able to identify content that is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not correct anymore</li>
        <li>Old and outdated</li>
        <li>Incorrectly lead to the conclusion</li>
        <li>No longer relevant to today's times</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Controls on the Lifetime</h3>
    <p>AI producers may specify:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Expiration date</li>
        <li>Automatic archival</li>
        <li>An automating visibility feature</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will allow a producer to indicate how long their content will exist online.</p>

    <h3>5. Digital Archives</h3>
    <p>By creating a high-quality AI archive, producers of high-quality AI-generated content can preserve them digitally long-term.</p>

    <h2>The Advantages of Declining Digital Content</h2>
    <p>The decline of Digital Content has some unexpected advantages.</p>
    <p>
        Digital decay, in some way, keeps the possibility of a "permanent" clutter in our digital world from ever existing, and thus creates many opportunities for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>New and Healthy Information Ecosystems</li>
        <li>The Ongoing Evolution of Knowledge</li>
        <li>Fresh Perspectives and Ideas</li>
        <li>Our Newest Understanding</li>
        <li>The Rebirth of Cultures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Just as we rebuild our cities, we also have the ability to grow and change our Digital Spaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion - AI Creates Content But Also Increases Its Fragility</h2>
    <p>More and faster production of content leads to it being less likely to exist for any length of time.</p>
    <p>Digital decay is not a problem; it is a natural component to our on-line existence. However, with AI, managing information about Digital Decay is going to be even more critical than in the present.</p>
    <p>
        In order to be considered "good" AI content, the following must also be included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Being Transparent About Its Availability Date</li>
        <li>Maintenance of Something That Has Been Created</li>
        <li>Being Very Clear About Its Contents And Availability Date - Being Future Focused</li>
        <li>Being Archived In A Responsible Manner</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With the Increase of Content Provided By Ai, The Challenge Is Not Only In The Continued Creation, But Also In The Preservation of Valuable Content For The Future.
