<h2>This is a practical manual for the novice user of AI</h2>
<p>For students, creators, and others who may have little prior experience with Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<h2>1. Thinking that Artificial Intelligence is Similar to Google</h2>
<p>
Many beginners treat AI like Google, asking short and vague questions and expecting perfect answers.  
AI responds based on patterns from training data, not real-time information.
</p>
<p>
Example:  
❌ “Explain photosynthesis”  
✔ “Explain photosynthesis in simple bullet points suitable for a 9th-grade student.”
</p>

<h2>2. Accepting AI Information as Being Accurate</h2>
<p>
Some users believe everything AI says without verifying it.  
AI can provide outdated or incorrect information.  
Always cross-check facts with textbooks or official websites before believing anything.
</p>
<p>
AI is a tool to support you, not a final source of truth.
</p>

<h2>3. Using AI as a Means of Cheating Rather Than Learning</h2>
<p>
Some users generate full homework or essays with AI.  
This prevents learning and development. Educators can easily detect AI-generated work.
</p>

<h2>⭐ 4. Provide Clear Instructions to AI</h2>

<h3>Mistake:</h3>
<p>Using vague prompts like “Improve this.”</p>

<h3>Why it’s a problem:</h3>
<p>AI does not know what “improve” means without context.</p>

<h3>How to fix:</h3>
<p>
✔ Use clear language  
✔ Specify tone, style, word count, purpose  
✔ Provide examples  
</p>
<p>
Example of a clear prompt:  
✔ “Rewrite this in plain English, 100–150 words, friendly tone.”
</p>

<h2>⭐ 5. Failing to Ask for Additional Clarification</h2>

<h3>Mistake:</h3>
<p>Stopping after the first response.</p>

<h3>Why it’s a problem:</h3>
<p>AI works best in long conversations with more context.</p>

<h3>How to avoid:</h3>
<p>
✔ Ask for clarification  
✔ Request alternatives  
✔ Ask for step-by-step explanations  
✔ Ask for examples or visuals  
</p>

<p>AI becomes more helpful the more context you add.</p>

<h2>⭐ 6. Entering Your Identity Information</h2>

<h3>Mistake:</h3>
<p>Sharing your address, school name, phone number, or personal details.</p>

<h3>Why it’s a problem:</h3>
<p>This creates security risks and is unnecessary.</p>

<h3>How to avoid:</h3>
<p>
✔ Never enter personal identity info  
✔ Use general information  
✔ Ask for help without personal details  
</p>

<p>
Instead of: ❌ “I go to St___ School…”  
Use: ✔ “I have a project about…”
</p>

<h2>⭐ 7. Thinking That AI Can Do Everything</h2>

<h3>Mistake:</h3>
<p>
Expecting AI to solve feelings, fix personal issues, replace teachers, or make decisions.
</p>

<h3>Why it’s a problem:</h3>
<p>
AI cannot replace emotional support or real-life problem solving.
</p>

<h3>How to fix:</h3>
<p>✔ Use AI only as a study assistant.</p>

<h2>#8: Inevitably Depending on AI Will Destroy Your Creativity</h2>

<h3>Mistake:</h3>
<p>Using AI for every idea or sentence.</p>

<h3>Why it’s a problem:</h3>
<p>Your creativity weakens over time.</p>

<h3>How to prevent it:</h3>
<p>
✔ Brainstorm your own ideas first  
✔ Use AI for guidance  
✔ Combine your ideas with AI suggestions  
</p>

<h2>#9: Not Understanding What AI Cannot Do</h2>

<h3>Mistake:</h3>
<p>
Believing AI knows everything, has emotions, understands the world like humans, or can read your mind.
</p>

<h3>Why it’s a problem:</h3>
<p>These assumptions create false expectations.</p>

<h3>How to prevent it:</h3>
<p>
✔ Remember AI follows patterns  
✔ AI does not think like humans  
✔ You must evaluate all AI-generated information  
</p>

<h2>#10: Using AI Tools Without Verifying Their Safety</h2>

<h3>Mistake:</h3>
<p>Teenagers download random AI apps from unknown websites.</p>

<h3>Why it's a problem:</h3>
<p>
Danger of malware, data theft, fake apps, scams.
</p>

<h3>How to prevent it:</h3>
<p>
✔ Use trusted websites  
✔ Avoid modded/cracked apps  
✔ Read reviews before using any tool  
</p>

<h2>#11: Using AI to Harass or Spread False Information</h2>

<h3>Mistake:</h3>
<p>Creating fake photos, screenshots, or stories.</p>

<h3>Why it's a problem:</h3>
<p>This is unethical and harms real people.</p>

<h3>How to prevent it:</h3>
<p>
✔ Use AI responsibly  
✔ Never create false information  
✔ Respect others' privacy  
</p>

<h2>#12: Expecting the Same AI Tool to Work for Everything</h2>
<p>
Different AI tools are designed for different purposes — one app cannot handle all tasks.
</p>

<h2>The Conclusion: Learn How to Use AI Effectively</h2>
<p>
Simple rule: <strong>THE POWER OF AI DEPENDS ON HOW YOU USE IT!</strong>
</p>

<p>
To use AI effectively:  
<br>>> PLAN AHEAD  
<br>>> ASK CLEAR QUESTIONS  
<br>>> VERIFY INFORMATION  
<br>>> USE AI AS A TEACHER, NOT A CHEAT  
<br>>> PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY  
<br>>> PRACTICE REAL SKILLS  
<br>>> ALWAYS BE ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE
