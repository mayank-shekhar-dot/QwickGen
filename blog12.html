               <h1>Hyper-Personal Web: Websites That Fully Reshape Themselves per User Using AI</h1>

<img src="blog12.png" alt="Hyper-Personal Web Illustration">

<h2>The internet is going to change rapidly</h2>

<p>How we experience websites is going to become more customized.</p>

<p>Today, when visiting a website, you’ll find that many parts of the website have been customized for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>The videos you see, the products you are recommended, the type of ads displayed to you, even the languages used on the site have all been chosen based on your interests and preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, regardless of the customization involved, the structure of the website (e.g., layout, navigation, text, tone, features) remains the same for every visitor to that site.</p>

<p>As advanced AI continues to improve at understanding a person's preferences, this limitation is going to end. We will enter the age of the Hyper-Personal Web, a new type of website that will have the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each user will have a unique layout</li>
<li>Each personality will have a unique design</li>
<li>Each reading style will have a unique tone</li>
<li>Each user will have a unique flow based on their behavior</li>
<li>Each time you visit the site, the experience will be different</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hyper-Personalised websites are not personalization</h2>

<p>They are recreating themselves to fit the user instead of forcing the user to fit into the website. Hyper-Personal Websites contain:</p>

<ul>
<li>A dynamic (as opposed to fixed) condition</li>
<li>An adaptive (as opposed to static) state</li>
<li>User shaped (as opposed to developer shaped)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Characteristics of the Hyper-Personal Web include:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Content that is continually updated based on users' needs</li>
<li>Structure that is continually changing based on users' behaviours</li>
<li>Visuals that are uniquely suited to users' interests</li>
<li>Features that are constantly being adapted to meet user expectations</li>
<li>Interactions that are generated in real-time based on users' actions</li>
</ul>

<p>When a visitor lands on a Hyper-Personalised website for the first time, they will see a completely different version of the same site than someone else.</p>

<h2>The Components that Comprise Hyper-Personalized Websites</h2>

<h3>1. Dynamic Modeling of Users</h3>

<p>AI gathers user information such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>How quickly users read</li>
<li>Users' scrolling patterns</li>
<li>Users' attention spans</li>
<li>Users' hesitation on clicking</li>
<li>Users' past interests</li>
<li>At what time of day Users accessed the website</li>
<li>Users' moods (analysed by words and language, not facial expressions)</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is compiled into a User State Graph = an ever-changing and updated User Model every second.</p>

<h3>2. Content Repurposing Engines</h3>

<p>Websites can create new content for them, using machine learning language models (MLLMs). New Content Repurposing Engines can also clone or modify existing documents and use them as they see fit, with modifications to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tone as Users prefer it</li>
<li>Readability at Users' levels</li>
<li>Adjusting with appropriate examples</li>
<li>Presented in both short and long formats, depending upon the format that Users prefer</li>
</ul>

<p>Two Users may read the same article and derive two complete, different pieces of text.</p>

<h3>3. Adaptive Layouts</h3>

<p>The layout for each website is adaptive to the User's characteristic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimalistic Layouts for fast readers</li>
<li>Visually Rich for visual learners</li>
<li>Step-by-step for novices</li>
<li>Compacted for Experts</li>
<li>Bright for daytime use</li>
<li>Dim for nighttime use</li>
</ul>

<p>UsersARE auto-generated their visual interface.</p>

<h3>4. Predictive Navigation</h3>

<p>The website can predict Users' navigation preferences by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rearranging Menus based on what the User is likely to need first</li>
<li>Prefetching Pages to load quickly</li>
<li>Removing Sections that are not relevant to Users</li>
<li>Reordering Action Links based on what the Users may need first</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, Users feel as though the website "knows" what type of action they will take next.</p>

<h3>5. Contextual Awareness</h3>

<p>The context of the User's current situation will influence the overall look of the website's design:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cellular vs Laptop Computer</li>
<li>Slow vs Fast Internet Connection</li>
<li>Leisure Time vs Work Time</li>
<li>Urgency Predicted based on the speed of the User's scroll</li>
<li>User's current concentration/focus or Mood</li>
</ul>

<p>The website aligns with Users' output at this moment, rather than time.</p>

<h3>Examples of Hyper-Personalized Websites in Practice</h3>

<h4>1. Supermarket website</h4>

<p>You and your buddy log into the same shopping site. Your version shows:</p>

<ul>
<li>clear site</li>
<li>vegetarian products only</li>
<li>deals for your frequently purchased items</li>
<li>recipe suggestions for your dietary restrictions</li>
<li>ingredients matched to what you already own at home</li>
</ul>

<p>Your friend's version shows:</p>

<ul>
<li>high protein foods featured</li>
<li>sports supplements prominently displayed</li>
<li>workout meals bundled together</li>
</ul>

<p>Same website, two completely different experiences.</p>

<h4>2. News website</h4>

<ul>
<li>You get shorter summaries if you are a casual observer (skimmer)</li>
<li>A neutral tone if you are a person who hates sensationalism</li>
<li>Analysis if you are willing to spend time on certain articles</li>
<li>Simplified graphics if you struggle with reading charts and graphs</li>
</ul>

<p>The site isn't really about the news; it shows you the type of news you want to read.</p>

<h4>3. Education platform</h4>

<ul>
<li>Lessons adapt to your speed of learning</li>
<li>The concepts that you struggle with</li>
<li>Examples that resonate with you</li>
<li>Your learning style (visual, auditory, or example-driven)</li>
</ul>

<p>The lesson is like your personal teacher.</p>

<h4>4. Work dashboards</h4>

<ul>
<li>Your work dashboard shows you items hidden that you will never use</li>
<li>Items prominently listed that you use often</li>
<li>Workflow customization based on your rhythm</li>
<li>Task notifications to remind you of tasks that you have forgotten to do</li>
</ul>

<p>Your co-worker's dashboard would look very different from yours.</p>

<h4>5. Entertainment platforms</h4>

<ul>
<li>Movies, music and games are curated according to your emotional patterns</li>
<li>Your mood</li>
<li>Your creative preferences</li>
<li>The friends you associate with</li>
<li>The time periods of your life</li>
</ul>

<h2>How AI Puts This into Technical Reality</h2>

<p>The Hyper-Personal Web’s underlying technology consists of the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>LLMs as Regenerators – These rewrite content, re-structure layouts, and generate new User Interface elements for your website</li>
<li>User Embeddings – Every user has a continuously updated vector profile</li>
<li>Behavior-Based Reinforcement Learning – The AI learns based on user response (Did you spend longer than normal? Did you leave immediately? Did you scroll? Did you ignore the item?). The AI will use the collected information to determine the content and structure of the next version of your website</li>
<li>Component-Level Modularity – Websites are built like Lego bricks; the AI will create the desired layout by moving the pieces around quickly</li>
<li>Predictive Analytics – The AI will determine the actions of a user and prepare accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h2>What A Designer / Developer Will Do In a Highly Personalised Web</h2>

<ul>
<li>A Designer will Build Systems not Screens</li>
<li>A Developer will Write Rules and Do Not Create Fixed Pages</li>
<li>A Content Writer will Write Templates and Do Not Write Individual Articles</li>
<li>A UX Researcher will Research Those Persona Clusters and Not Average Users</li>
</ul>

<h2>No Longer Hand-Crafted/Generative Content</h2>

<h2>The Advantages of the Hyper-Personal Web</h2>

<ul>
<li>Zero Cognitive Friction – There Are No Confusing Or Cluttered Elements. Just What Is Important to You.</li>
<li>Maximum Engagement – Your Website Will Learn to Shape Itself Around What Keeps You Interested.</li>
<li>Revolutionize the Accessibility of People with Different Abilities by Creating Unique Interfaces For Them.</li>
<li>Faster Navigation – Your Website Will Anticipate Your Journey.</li>
<li>Emotional Comfort – A Unique Tone Will Create A More Personal Relationship.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ethical and Risk Considerations of The Hyper-Personal Web</h2>

<ul>
<li>⚠️ Too Much Personalization – Helps you feel stuck in one place.</li>
<li>⚠️ Ability to Manipulate – You are more likely to be swayed because of a fully personalized user interface.</li>
<li>⚠️ No Shared Experience of the Web – Everyone else sees the Web differently.</li>
<li>⚠️ Privacy of User Information – User information is vulnerable to misuse if it is not modeled and used securely and transparently.</li>
<li>⚠️ Inaccuracies in AI Created User Interfaces – You should not have to check AI-generated user interfaces for any inaccuracies or safety concerns.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hyper-Personal Web needs an appropriate amount of ethical oversight.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts: The Web Is Yours</h2>

<p>There will come a day when, when you visit a website:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't load a homepage</li>
<li>It loads a homepage that is customized for you</li>
<li>It is designed to match your user preferences</li>
<li>It has been structured to align with your patterns of use</li>
<li>Its colors, tone, format and features will all be customized for you</li>
</ul>

<p>The web will be like looking in a mirror. It will show you not how you are related to the world, but how you are related to the person you are.</p>

<p>The next iteration of the digital world will not only have advanced speed and intelligence; however it will also be uniquely designed for you.</p>
