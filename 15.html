For example, QuickGen AI is often used to report audience age, locations, and interest groups that are likely to engage with a product or service you offer.</p>

    <h2>Examples of AI in audience research</h2>
    <p>For example, if you sell a product, AI will be able to provide insight on which of your customers are the most likely to be interested in your product based on previous buying patterns. If you sell a service, AI will assist by providing common audience problems they want solved. AI can utilize feedback and reviews to learn about audience likes and dislikes.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of using AI for audience insights</h2>
    <p>AI makes audience research easier, more accurate, and actionable. It helps organizations focus on the correct audience while delivering solutions that will work.
